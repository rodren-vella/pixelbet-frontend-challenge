# Rodren Vella - Pixel.bet Front-End Challenge

This is my interpretation of the "Pixel.bet Front-End Challenge". Below is some information on how you can get the application up and running.

## Available Scripts

In the project's root directory, you can run the following:

### `npm run start`

* Builds and bundles the application in production mode which optimizes it for debugging as it leaves source maps.
* Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.
* The page will reload if you make edits.
* You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

* Builds and bundles the application in production mode which optimizes it for the best possible performance.
* The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## How to: Get up and running

1. In the root directory, open a terminal window and run: `node server/src/app.js` to turn on the Node server.
2. Similarly, but in a separate terminal window, run `npm run start` to launch the app itself.
3. Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.
